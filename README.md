## NEWM-N320: Final Project

# Mini Conference Application Using Vue

For our final project, we were to use Vue to create a mini conference application. The application would allow users to see various sessions offered, filter the session based on categories or presenters, and add a session to their own list.

For this project, HomeSessions is the home view, which shows the users the various sessions available to them. They show the session title, presenter, day and time, descriptions, and categories it belongs to. They are able to click on the presenter name or a specific tag to filter through and see specfic sessions. In this page, they are also able to add / remove a session from their list.

UserSessions is the second view, which shows the users their selected sessions. It shows the session title, day, and time. They are able to navigate back to HomeSessions to add more sessions to their list.
